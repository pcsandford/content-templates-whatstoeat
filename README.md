## Introduction

What's to Eat?, a customizable interactive digital display to show the location of, and directions to, local places to eat. Users are able to touch the card for the restaurant of their choice and scan the corresponding QR code to get directions on their mobile device. Using the google-maps web component the directions will also be shown on the display. Users can recommend their favourite places to others by touching the heart icons on the cards.
What's to Eat? works in conjunction with Rise Vision, the digital signage management application that runs on Google Cloud.

At this time Chrome is the only browser that this project and Rise Vision supports.
